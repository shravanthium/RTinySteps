==========

Have used two different datasets to try the basic things in R

#1 DataSet of Cases registered and their disposal under crime against Women : http://data.gov.in/catalog/cases-registered-and-their-disposal-under-crime-against-women#web_catalog_tabs_block_10
#2 Cancer Dataset :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/

#1 dataset is used to play aroud the plots available in R.
#2 dataset is used to build the naive bayes calssification model.
